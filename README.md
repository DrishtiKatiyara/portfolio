# portfolio
My portfolio website.
This is the basic project for personal portfolio using HTML, CSS and JS (JQuery for some mathematical animations).
Javascript code is included in  HTML itself, I'll separate it properly within some time & update.
Next goal for all of us who ever is reading this must be creating portfolio websites using react - a JavaScript Library.
